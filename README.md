TODOS:

for game page:

- store who is the user
- store who is the opponent
- Opponent can press alphabet buttons ONLY: a grid of letters that are buttons that can be picked by the player and an 'X', or a fade/color change, or disappear button after picked.
- hook up buttons so that
- hook up game letters to populate when correct letter pressed.
- make the game responsive for various screen sizes
- make everything pretty
- game over message with win or loss?
- hook up the play again to reload the component for the input box for a word to be put in again. meanwhile, the opponent is pushed to gamepage and the word that is below the hangman could be a message saying "waiting for game creator to input another word" or something like that.

Optional things:

- make a function that allows players to swap from opponent to player after game ends.
- make a log that tracks all the games for a specific player
- make a schema for a game that creates a game object whenever a new game is started and can say whether opponent figured out the word or not.

TO FIGURE OUT:

- how to have multiple sessions at one time with one db.
- should I even have a db that tracks strikes? or should I do something that persists on the front end during game play?
